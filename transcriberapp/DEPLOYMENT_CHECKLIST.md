## 🔴 CRITICAL - Must Complete Before Play Store

### 1. Deploy Backend to Production Server
Your backend is currently running locally on `192.168.1.34:8000`.

**Options:**
- **Heroku** (Free tier available): https://www.heroku.com/
- **Railway** (Easy deployment): https://railway.app/
- **DigitalOcean App Platform**: https://www.digitalocean.com/products/app-platform
- **AWS EC2** (More control): https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/
- **Google Cloud Run** (Serverless): https://cloud.google.com/run

**After deployment:**
1. Get your production URL (e.g., `https://your-app.railway.app`)
2. Update `.env` file:
   ```
   SERVER_URL=https://your-app.railway.app
   ```
3. Ensure backend has HTTPS (required for production)

### 2. Create Release Signing Key

```bash
# Generate keystore
keytool -genkey -v -keystore ~/audio-transcriber-keystore.jks -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -validity 10000 -alias audio-transcriber

# Follow prompts to set password and details
```

**Create `android/key.properties`:**
```properties
storePassword=YOUR_STORE_PASSWORD
keyPassword=YOUR_KEY_PASSWORD
keyAlias=audio-transcriber
storeFile=C:/Users/YourName/audio-transcriber-keystore.jks
```

**Update `android/app/build.gradle.kts`:**

Add before `android {` block:
```kotlin
val keystorePropertiesFile = rootProject.file("key.properties")
val keystoreProperties = java.util.Properties()
if (keystorePropertiesFile.exists()) {
    keystoreProperties.load(java.io.FileInputStream(keystorePropertiesFile))
}
```

Inside `android {` block, add:
```kotlin
signingConfigs {
    create("release") {
        keyAlias = keystoreProperties["keyAlias"] as String
        keyPassword = keystoreProperties["keyPassword"] as String
        storeFile = file(keystoreProperties["storeFile"] as String)
        storePassword = keystoreProperties["storePassword"] as String
    }
}

buildTypes {
    release {
        signingConfig = signingConfigs.getByName("release")
    }
}
```

⚠️ **BACKUP YOUR KEYSTORE FILE!** If you lose it, you can never update your app!

### 3. Host Privacy Policy Publicly

Upload `PRIVACY_POLICY.md` to:
- GitHub Pages
- Your website
- Google Sites (free)

Get the public URL (e.g., `https://yourusername.github.io/privacy-policy`)

### 4. Update Privacy Policy Contact Info

Edit `PRIVACY_POLICY.md` and replace:
- `[your-email@example.com]` with your real email
- `[Your Name/Company]` with your name
